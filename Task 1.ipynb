    "If your company uses a conventional bad-debt provisioning process where 10% on all accounts that pay late is reserved, this doesn’t necessarily account for deeper historical behavior. Simply reserving that much currency can negatively impact expenses, especially when only certain customers – say your biggest – pay late only occasionally. Through segmentation, you can see that the dollars actually at risk could be considerably lower than when the surface data was examined. When you rely on risk-based analytics, you may conclude that such accounts are much more likely to present a very low risk. Therefore, you could be reserving 1%, not 10% as the traditional approach might dictate."

In other words, we can say that there’s a skew towards the end, right?\n",
